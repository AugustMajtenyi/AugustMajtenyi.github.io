							<h2>Combining the Data</h2>
							<!-- <h4>View my initial code</h4> -->
							<p>The files were <em>not</em> easily transferrable. A had to manually edit a handful country/region names. The merged dataframe contains <b>899 observations</b> of <b>157 unique countries</b> representing<br><b>10 regions</b> around the world. Below is a quick representation of the data:</p>

							<h2>Initial Evaluation</h2>
							<div id=SharedKnowledgeChart1 style="width: 800px; height: 280px; overflow: hidden;">
								<img src="images/WHR-Immigration/AcceptedImmHappiness_Scat.png" alt="Accepted Immigration + Happiness Scatterplot" width=263px height=263px>
								<img src="images/WHR-Immigration/EmigrantsHappiness_Scat.png" alt="Emigrants + Happiness Scatterplot" width=262px height=263px>

							</div>
							<p><b>The Charts show just about what you'd expect:</b><br>
							Immigrants are going to 'happier' countries and emigrating from less happy countries. From this trend, it follows that 'happier' countries also have higher counts of Rejecting Immigrants.</p>
							<br>
							<p><b><em>Let's go deeper</em></b></p>
							<br>
							<h3>The Ratio of Accepted vs. Rejected Immmigration Decisions</h3>
							<br>
							<div id=SharedKnowledgeChart1 style="width: 800px; height: 300px; overflow: hidden;">
								<img src="images/WHR-Immigration/ImmRatioHappiness_Scat.png" alt="Immigration Acceptance Ratio + Happiness Scatterplot" width=397px height=300px>

							</div>
							<br>
							<P><b>Analysis</b></p>
							<p>Overall, there is a negative correlation <b>(r = -0.192)</b> between Immigration Acceptance Percentage and the World Happiness Scores for countries. </p>
							<br>
							<p>The scatterplot by region was particularly interesting to me.
								The <b>3 lines of regression at the top</b> stand out from the other regions.
								From top to bottom respectively, they belong to <b>Australia and New Zealand</b>, <b>North America</b>, and <b>Western Europe</b>.
								These happen to also be the only three regions where all countries have positive migration population.
							<br>
							<em>This me leads to a new question...</em></p>
							<br>
							<h4><b>Is there a significant relationship</b> between Happiness and Immigration Acceptance Ratio <b>with Positive Migration Regions?</b></h4>

							<h2>Positive, but not Certain</h2>
							<div id=BadGraph style="width: 800px; height: 300px; overflow: hidden;">
								<img src="images/WHR-Immigration/ImmRatioHappiness_3Region_Scat2.png" alt="Immigration Acceptance Ratio + Happiness Scatterplot For 3 Regions" width=582px height=300px>
								<img src="images/WHR-Immigration/ImmRatioCor_Chart.png" alt="Happiness and Correlation chart for 3 region" width=212 height=300px>
							</div>
							<br/>
							<p>From the scatterlplot above, we see a <b>positive correlation</b> between Immigration Acceptance Ratio and Happiness,
							 but with a pearson correlation of <b>r = .107</b>, it is not significant <b>(p=.203)</b></p>
							</br>
							<h3>Finding Significance</h3>
							<br>
							<div id=BadGraph style="width: 800px; height: 250px; overflow: hidden;">
								<img src="images/WHR-Immigration/GenImmRatio_DistCor_Hist.png" alt="Immigration Acceptance Ratio + Happiness Scatterplot For 3 Regions" height=249px>
								<img src="images/WHR-Immigration/GenImmRatio_Scat.png" alt="Happiness and Correlation chart for 3 region"  height=249px>
							</div>
							<br/>
							<p>There is however, a significant correlation to be found. Generosity Score, which is determined by how much a country donates to charity, has a <b>p-value of .006</b> (shown from the histogram above)</p>

							<h2>Reflection</h2>
              				<h3><b>The hidden bias of data analysis</b></h3>
							<p>I found a correlation that was significant, but at what cost?
							 The original data showed a negative correlation, but <b>I narrowed the data</b> and found a positive one.
							 <b>Was it justified?</b>
							 I'm sure I could easily have analyzed the same data in a different way to find a totally different conclusion.</p>
							<br/>
							<h3>Research Limitations</h3>
							<p>Continuing this research with different recent years could test the validity of the trends I found.
							 Also, region organization greatly impacted on my findings (Ex: Mexico was not in North America). This categorization is from the World Happiness Report; I'm not sure how they decided this.</p>
							<br/>
							<h3>Next Steps</h3>
                				<p>I would like to <b>develop my skills in R/Rstudio</b>. I would like exposure to different packages and control structures. Coming back to this data after gaining more experience could prove useful.</p>
